## Yo. How did you end up here?

This project was built with Next.js, RadixUI, Tailwind CSS, and React. All of the components were created following the BuildUI [Advanced Radix UI](https://buildui.com/courses/advanced-radix-ui) course. I wrote the components in jsx because what are types anywayz?

## TV shows my wife and I watched during the making of this project (no one asked)

I recommend you watch them too:

- Bad Batch
- Modern Family
- Three Body Problem

## Why are you still reading? / What I learned building this

First and foremost, Radix absolutely rules. I have no business putting together components like this with my current knowledge of javascript and modern front-end.

Secondly, BuildUI absolutely rules. Sam's attention to detail rivals many designers I have worked with/for and his technical knowledge is just as high. Most importantly, Sam is a great teacher. The ability to teach is so rare, and it is more rare still to find someone with Sam's level of skill who can also teach. Signing up for BuildUI was money well spent.

Beyond that, here are some really basic things I took away from the course:

- Basic knowledge of useState() in React
- Basic knowledge to use Next.js app router
- How to run my dev server so that I can access it on my phone
- Clear understanding of position: relative and its relationship to position: absolute
- A love for Tailwind
- A disdain for Tailwind / a desire to try CVA next
- How to use pointer events and how they're different from mouse events (definitely going to share this with my engineers!)
- How easy it can be to recreate fundamental behaviors for dragging/slidering so that user have a polished experience regardless of surface or input method (mouse, keyboard, hands, etc.)
